# About PackIt

PackIt is an interactive web application that helps you keep track of the three most important organizational aspects of your trip: **What do I have to pack? What arrangements do I have to make? What errands do I have to run?**

## Features
- Create a new trip
- Enter trip data
- Select components (activities, accomodation, transportation, other)
- Based on the trip data, three lists are generated:
  - To-Do
  - To-Pack
  - To-Buy
- Work off lists

# Project Setup
## A webpack 4 based setup

### Installation
* If you haven't already, install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* `npm install`

### How to use
* `npm start` starts a local server. If you change any of the files in `src/`, the browser will reflect the changes automatically ("autorefresh", "autoreload").
* `npm run build` builds a production bundle in `dist/`
* `npm run prettier` formattes code
* `npm run lint` analyzes code for errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs
* `npm run fix` fixes errors from linting

### Features
* uses sass (supporting the scss-syntax), minifies and auto-prefixes your css for production
* auto-prefixing depending on your choice of browsers you want to support in `.browserslist.rc`
* uses hashes for the js/css-filenames to prevent caching problems
* autorefreshes browsers (autoreloads)
* concatenates and minifies your js-files using webpack's intelligent dependency graph
* ES6 support via babel out of the box
* creates all the files needed for production in the build directory
* minifies images (jpg, png, jpg, svg)
* includes various icon references for touch devices

## Learning Goals

We both have similar skills, which is why we have decided to set common learning goals for both of us.

Our strengths are HTML and CSS. However, through our different approaches, we can also learn something from each other in these areas.

The top priority is the deepening of our Javascript knowledge.

We can also improve our workflow in terms of using Git. We want to learn how to work effectively on a project at the same time, without causing too many merging conflicts. And how to solve conflicts quickly and professionally.

In terms of project management, we also hope to learn something new in order to plan and structure the next projects even better.
